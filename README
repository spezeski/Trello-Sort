Display sorted lists in Trello.  The sorting options (due date, labels, # of votes, last activity, and card #) are available in the List Actions menu.

If you don't see them there, try refreshing.

It only changes the ordering that you see, it doesn't change the actual ordering within Trello.  Any sorting you do will not affect the list for any other user.
